|-----------|-------------|---------------|------|----------|--------|-------------|------|------------------------------|-----|
| version | Version of the schema to use when validating this metadata. | Shared by all types | 1 | True |   |   |   |   |   |
| description | Free-text description of this assay. | Shared by all types |   | True |   |   |   |   |   |
| donor_id | HuBMAP Display ID of the donor of the assayed tissue. Example: ABC123. | Shared by all types |   | True |   |   |   | [A-Z]+[0-9]+ |   |
| tissue_id | HuBMAP Display ID of the assayed tissue. Example: ABC123-BL-1-2-3_456. | Shared by all types |   | True |   |   |   | (([A-Z]+[0-9]+)-[A-Z]{2}\d*(-\d+)+(_\d+)?)(,([A-Z]+[0-9]+)-[A-Z]{2}\d*(-\d+)+(_\d+)?)* |   |
| execution_datetime | Start date and time of assay, typically a date-time stamped folder generated by the acquisition instrument. YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month with leading 0s, and DD is the day with leading 0s, hh is the hour with leading zeros, mm are the minutes with leading zeros. | Shared by all types |   | True | %Y-%m-%d %H:%M |   | datetime |   |   |
| protocols_io_doi | DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for this assay. | Shared by all types |   | True |   |   |   | 10\.17504/.* | prefix: https://dx.doi.org/ |
| operator | Name of the person responsible for executing the assay. | Shared by all types |   | True |   |   |   |   |   |
| operator_email | Email address for the operator. | Shared by all types |   | True | email |   |   |   |   |
| pi | Name of the principal investigator responsible for the data. | Shared by all types |   | True |   |   |   |   |   |
| pi_email | Email address for the principal investigator. | Shared by all types |   | True | email |   |   |   |   |
| assay_category | Each assay is placed into one of the following 4 general categories: generation of images of microscopic entities, identification & quantitation of molecules by mass spectrometry, imaging mass spectrometry, and determination of nucleotide sequence. | Shared by all types | imaging | True |   |   |   |   |   |
| assay_type | The specific type of assay being executed. | Shared by all types | AF | True |   |   |   |   |   |
| analyte_class | Analytes are the target molecules being measured with the assay. Leave blank if not applicable. | Shared by all types |   | False |   |   |   |   |   |
| is_targeted | Specifies whether or not a specific molecule(s) is/are targeted for detection/measurement by the assay. | Shared by all types |   | True |   |   | boolean |   |   |
| acquisition_instrument_vendor | An acquisition instrument is the device that contains the signal detection hardware and signal processing software. Assays generate signals such as light of various intensities or color or signals representing the molecular mass. | Shared by all types |   | True |   |   |   |   |   |
| acquisition_instrument_model | Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data. | Shared by all types |   | True |   |   |   |   |   |
| resolution_x_value | The width of a pixel. | Unique to this type |   | True |   |   | number |   |   |
| resolution_x_unit | The unit of measurement of the width of a pixel. Leave blank if not applicable. | Unique to this type | nm or um | False |   | resolution_x_value present |   |   |   |
| resolution_y_value | The height of a pixel. | Unique to this type |   | True |   |   | number |   |   |
| resolution_y_unit | The unit of measurement of the height of a pixel. Leave blank if not applicable. | Unique to this type | nm or um | False |   | resolution_y_value present |   |   |   |
| resolution_z_value | Optional if assay does not have multiple z-levels. Note that this is resolution within a given sample: z-pitch (resolution_z_value) is the increment distance between image slices, ie. the microscope stage is moved up or down in increments to capture images of several focal planes. | Unique to this type |   | True |   |   | number |   |   |
| resolution_z_unit | The unit of incremental distance between image slices. Leave blank if not applicable. | Unique to this type | mm, um, or nm | False |   | resolution_z_value present |   |   |   |
| number_of_channels | Number of channels capturing the emission spectrum from natural fluorophores in the sample. | Unique to this type |   | True |   |   | integer |   |   |
| overall_protocols_io_doi | DOI for protocols.io referring to the overall protocol for the assay. | Unique to this type |   | True |   |   |   | 10\.17504/.* | prefix: https://dx.doi.org/ |
| contributors_path | Relative path to file with ORCID IDs for contributors for this dataset. | Unique to this type |   | True |   |   |   |   |   |
| data_path | Relative path to file or directory with instrument data. Downstream processing will depend on filename extension conventions. | Unique to this type |   | True |   |   |   |   |   |
