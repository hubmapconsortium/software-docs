# Cell DIVE / cell-dive

## Overview:
CellDIVE uploads require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay to be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For CellDIVE, the channel_id is represented as a cycle#/channel# combination (of the form Cycle[0-9]_CH[0-9]) linked to a given image file in the directory.
The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies. For more information, see the Antibodies TSV documentation.
