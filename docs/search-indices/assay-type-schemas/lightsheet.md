# Light Sheet

## Overview:
Lightsheet uploads require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay to be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For Lightsheet, the channel_id is the name of the fluorophore tag on the antibody. For an example of a lightsheet dataset & directory, see this  example lightsheet dataset  and click the Globus link. 
Version 2 has 5 new fields for metadata describing the Z-dimension specifically relevant to lightsheet. These values provide the total number of image sections captured, the incremental value and unit of distance between the sections and the value and unit of the total distance captured.
The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies. For more information, see the Antibodies TSV documentation.
