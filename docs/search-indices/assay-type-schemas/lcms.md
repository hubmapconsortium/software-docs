# LC-MS / MS / LC-MS Bottom-Up / MS Bottom-Up / LC-MS Top-Down / MS Top-Down

## Overview:
This schema is for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS).
v2 adds mass_resolving_power, mz_resolving_power, ion_mobility, spatial_type, spatial_sampling_type, spatial_target, and resolution_{x/y}_{value/unit}. In the case of datasets in which more than one analyte_type was interrogated (e.g. lipids plus metabolytes), those datasets should be split into one dataset per analyte.
v3 adds dms and label_name fields, and negative and positive ion mode as a polarity option.
