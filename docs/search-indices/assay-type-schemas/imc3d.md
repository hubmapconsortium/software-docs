# 3D Imaging Mass Cytometry

## Overview:
This schema is for 3 dimensional imaging mass cytometry (IMC 3D). 3D IMC uploads require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay to be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For 3D IMC, the channel_id is the name of the metal tag on the corresponding antibody.
The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies. For more information, see the Antibodies TSV documentation.
